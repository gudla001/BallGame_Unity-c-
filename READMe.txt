brief introduction: first scene you will be able to choose from two games, Roll a ball and catch the ball 
roll a ball you use the arrows as inputs and will be able to move around and trying to catch rotating objects.
second game I used the car game provided by standard assets with minor changes, I changed the physical part of
the car so it would be able to go faster. in this game we use the arrows as inputs and we are supposed to chase down the self moving ball before it escapes out of our map.
I watched a few videos of how to make a scene selection from unity and put them together and this is what i came up with.

I learned the very basics of creating a game or putting together a game and to lunch it on my PC which was very cool. I also learned how to use git bash to push my files to github. And in the future i hope to get better at making games and make my own from scratch.
